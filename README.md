What if the earth was the size of our house, and our street was the center of the solar system? Where would the earth be? Where would Jupiter be and how big would it be?

> Note, our house was a 3-story condo, near Rutgers (New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA)

| Object | Diameter | Orbit distance | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sun | 1.3km | 0m | The Sun's outer edge would reach to the bridge across the Raritan River. It's as tall is 109 of our houses—327 stories tall! (Recall One World Trade Center is just 541 meters tall, and the Burj Khalifa is 830 meters tall!) |
| Jupiter | 128m | 714.8km | Jupiter is in Columbus, Ohio. It's as big as *eleven* of our houses. |
| Saturn | 107m | 1,310.1km | Saturn is in the middle of Illinois. Or in northern Florida, like around Jacksonville. It's as big as nine of our houses. |
| Uranus | 46.6m | 2,636.2km | Uranus is in Denver, Colorado. It'd be as tall as four of our houses, or our house to the mailboxes. |
| Neptune | 45.2m | 4,130.4km | Neptune is is San Francisco, California. It's almost as big as Uranus, 3.8 houses. |
| Earth | 11.7m | 137.4km | Earth is as big as our house, an hour into Pennsylvania. Or down in Atlantic City, in southern Jersey. |
| Venus | 11.1m | 99.4km | Venus is a bit smaller than our house: about half a meter shorter. It's in Connecticut, or in the middle of Long Island, or in eastern Pennsylvania, just 20 minutes away from where Earth would be. |
| Mars | 6.22m | 209.3km | Mars half the size of our house. It'd reach to the middle of the middle story. It's near Baltimore, Maryland. Or, almost to Rhode Island! |
| Ganymede (Jupiter III) | 4.84m | 983m | Ganymede is a bit (just 1.5 meters) smaller than Mars, so maybe from the driveway to the bottom of the first floor. Remember Jupiter is as big as eleven of our houses, out in Columbus, Ohio? Ganymede is about a kilometer away from that mansion. That's almost all the way from our house to Tacoria. |
| Titan (Saturn VI) | 4.72m | 1.1km | Titan is just a little shorter than Ganymede, but orbits around Saturn, which is in the middle of Illinois (or in northern Florida). Titan is a bit more than a kilometer away from Saturn, so just about to Tacoria. Remember Saturn is as big as nine of our houses (bigger than our whole street!, because remember, our houses are *tall* but *skinny*). |
| Mercury | 4.48m | 53.2km | Mercury is just a little shorter than Titan and Ganymede. If the center of the Sun was in our driveway (and the edge of the Sun was at the Raritan River), then Mercury is up in Central Park, in Manhattan. |
| Callisto (Jupiter IV) | 4.43m | 1.7km | Callisto is next in line, over four meters tall (two daddies), and like Ganymede she orbits Jupiter. Remember Jupiter is that ridiculous eleven-house mansion out in Columbus? Ganymede is about a kilometer away from that house, but Callisto is almost *two* kilometers away. |
| Io (Jupiter I) | 3.35m | 387m | Io is about as tall as our basement. She orbits around Jupiter too (remember, eleven-house mansion), but her orbit is really close to Jupiter: she's less than 400 meters away, which is like from our house to a bit past the field. |
| Moon (Luna) | 3.19m | 353m | Our moon is a bit smaller than Io, fitting inside our garage—or just as tall as a basketball hoop. If Earth is as big as our house, out in Pennsylvania, the Moon is that big but about as far from our house as Io is from Jupiter: a bit past our field. |
| Europa (Jupiter II) | 2.87m | 616m | Europa would be as big as the tallest man in the world (Robert Wadlow, almost nine feet tall, one foot below the basketball hoop). Like Ganymede, Callisto, and Io, she orbits around Jupiter out in Columbus. It goes: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, in terms of distance from Jupiter. If the distance between Jupiter and Io is like our house and the field, then Europa is in New Brunswick. |
| Triton (Neptune I) | 2.49m | 326m | Triton is amazing! Retrograde, very elliptical orbit around Neptune (which, remember, would be about four of our houses tall, out in San Francisco). The distance between Triton and Neptune would be like our house and the field. Triton is like two heads taller than daddy.  |
| Pluto | 2.19m | 5,423.4km | Pluto is our first planetoid on our list! It's a tad taller than daddy. But it's pretty far away: if the Earth was as big as our house, Pluto would be a bit taller than daddy, out in Anchorage, Alaska. Or in the middle of Peru. Or in London, England. |
| Eris | 2.14m | 9,295.2km | Eris like Pluto would be a bit taller than daddy… but out in Egypt. Or in the middle of the Pampas in Argentina. Or almost to Hokkaido. |
| Titania (Uranus III) | 1.45m | 400m | Titania is our first Uranian moon! Remember Uranus would be as big as four of our houses out in Denver, Colorado? Titania would be as big as a grade schooler, about as far as from our house to the field. |
| Haumea | 1.4m | 5,952.7km | Haumea like Titania and the rest of these little ones are about as big as a grade schooler. But if the middle of the sun was in our driveway, Haumea is really far away: out past Pluto, placing her in northern Alaska or southern Peru or in France. |
| Rhea (Saturn V) | 1.4m | 484m | Rhea, like Titan, orbits Saturn, which would be out in Illinois or just inside Florida and as big as nine of our houses. Rhea would be about a grade schooler's size, half-a-kilometer away from that Saturn, which is a bit farther than the field. |
| Oberon (Uranus IV) | 1.4m | 536m | Oberon like Titania orbits Uranus (as big as four of our houses in Denver, Colorado), but whereas Titania is about 400 meters away from that house, Oberon is a bit farther, like across the Raritan. |
| Iapetus (Saturn VIII) | 1.35m | 3.3km | Iapetus like Titan and Rhea orbits Saturn (which is like nine houses out in Illinois or Florida). Iapetus is a little guy like a grade schooler's size but, whereas Rhea and Titan were kind of close to Saturn (half a kilometer and one kilometer, respectively), Iapetus would be *three* kilometers away, like from our house to H-Mart. |
| Makemake | 1.31m | 6,290.2km | Makemake and Haumea pretty similar in that they'd both be about the size of a grade schooler—Makemake is ten centimeters shorter—and are super-far away from the Sun. If Pluto is in Alaska/Peru/England, and Haumea in northern Alaska/southern Peru/France, then Makemake is out in Russia, or by the Peruvian–Chilean border, or at the French–German border. Still not as far away as Eris (out in Egypt, or Argentina, or Hokkaido). |
| Ceres | 0.868m | 379.9km | Ceres is our first asteroid! She's littler than a kindergartener, and between Mars (Baltimore or Rhode Island) and Jupiter (Columbus) with all the other members of the Asterid Belt: in western Pennsylvania, or New Hamshire, or north Virginia. |
